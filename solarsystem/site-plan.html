    <p>
      I have good news! For the next years, you and I will live together in a single very specific point in the
      universe. More specifically, this point is the Earth Not just us but the Earth too, for the next years we will
      live together with some planets, moons and asteroids in a specific place called: Solar System. The solar system is
      defined by everything that is gravitationally bound to our sun (and it is our home also). It consists in the
      planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of
      moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. But when did we discover that the Solar System is our
      house? In 1500 Nicolaus Copernicus discovered that the planets orbit the Sun. Only the Moon orbits the Earth. But
      he was afraid of people's reaction when he said this, so he didn't publish a full account of his ideas until 1543,
      the year of his death. So, Galileo Galilei pointed a telescope at the sky. He discovered moons orbiting Jupiter.
      He then verified that Copernicus might be right. It took 70 years to convince scientists that planets orbit the
      Sun. Currently, many people know what the Solar System is. That's it, this is our home. As residents of this
      wonderful place, we should meet our neighborhood! Please fasten your seat belts, put on your spacesuit and join me
      on this journey into the Solar System.

    <h3>Planets</h3>
    <p>
      Each planet in the solar system has peculiarities so that they are classified according to their constitution. In
      this aspect we can highlight two types of planets:
      terrestrial planets (made up mainly of rocks), located closer to the sun such as Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars
      and
      gaseous planets (made up mostly of gases), which are larger in size and less dense than terrestrial ones: Jupiter,
      Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Planets are in constant motion so that they revolve around their own orbit or around
      the Sun.

      The rotation movement designates the movement that the planets perform around their own axis (equivalent to the
      time of 1 day).

      The translation movement defines the movement that the planets perform around the sun (equivalent to the time of 1
      year).

    <h3>Sun, Moon and more</h3>
    <p>

      At the center of the Solar System is the Sun. He is a star, like the billions of other stars in the sky. The other
      stars look small because they are so far away from us.
      The Sun is important because it is what allows life on Earth, it provides the light, heat and energy. Without the
      sun, no life would exist on our planet. The diameter of the Sun is 1.392 million kilometers. It is mainly composed
      of hydrogen and helium, as well as iron, nickel, oxygen, silicon, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, etc. Its temperature
      varies, reaching up to 5,505 degrees Celsius at the surface and 16 million degrees Celsius at the core. Fun fact:
      a trip from Earth to the Sun, in a spacecraft, would take about 124 days. Many of the planets have moons. The moon
      is a body that orbits a planet. Earth has a moon. Our Moon, orbits (moves around) the Earth. The Moon is Earth's
      only natural satellite. It is 384,400 km from the planet, and every year it moves 3.78 centimeters away. It has a
      thin and fragile exosphere, and its structure is composed of crust, mantle and core. Its surface is littered with
      impact craters, rock fragments and dust. The planet Mercury has no moon and neither does Venus. On the other hand,
      Jupiter has 63 moons.
