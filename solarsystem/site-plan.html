    <p>
      I have good news! For the next years, you and I will live together in a single very specific point in the
      universe. More specifically, this point is the Earth Not just us but the Earth too, for the next years we will
      live together with some planets, moons and asteroids in a specific place called: Solar System. The solar system is
      defined by everything that is gravitationally bound to our sun (and it is our home also). It consists in the
      planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of
      moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. But when did we discover that the Solar System is our
      house? In 1500 Nicolaus Copernicus discovered that the planets orbit the Sun. Only the Moon orbits the Earth. But
      he was afraid of people's reaction when he said this, so he didn't publish a full account of his ideas until 1543,
      the year of his death. So, Galileo Galilei pointed a telescope at the sky. He discovered moons orbiting Jupiter.
      He then verified that Copernicus might be right. It took 70 years to convince scientists that planets orbit the
      Sun. Currently, many people know what the Solar System is. That's it, this is our home. As residents of this
      wonderful place, we should meet our neighborhood! Please fasten your seat belts, put on your spacesuit and join me
      on this journey into the Solar System.

    <h3>Planets</h3>
    <p>
      Each planet in the solar system has peculiarities so they are classified according to their constitution.
      In this aspect, we can highlight two types of planets: terrestrial planets (made up mainly of rocks),
      located closer to the sun such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, and gaseous planets (made up mostly
      of gases), which are larger and less dense than terrestrial ones: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
      Planets are in constant motion so that they revolve around their orbit or the Sun. The rotation movement
      designates the movement that the planets perform around their axis (equivalent to the time of 1 day).
      The translation movement defines the movement that the planets perform around the sun (equivalent to the
      time of 1 year). Are you enjoying this trip?

    <h3>Sun, Moon and more</h3>
    <p>

      The Moon is the only natural satellite of the planet Earth. This celestial body has a radius
      of approximately 1740 km, which makes it the fifth-largest moon in the entire Solar System.
      The Moon's mass is 7.35 x 1019 tons, a value that corresponds to only 1.23% of the Earth's
      mass. It is positioned at 384,400 km from our planet, an interval at least 18 times greater
      than when it formed, 4.5 billion years ago. The distancing process has not ceased, and each
      year it increases by 3.78 centimeters.



      According to NASA, the satellite has a very thin and fragile atmospheric layer called the
      exosphere, which does not provide any type of protection. As a result, a series of meteorite
      impact craters can be observed on its surface, in addition to debris and layers and layers
      of rocky debris (regoliths) and dust, developed throughout its existence as a result of the
      impacts.



      There are areas of high relief on the surface of the Moon resulting from the filling of
      craters by lava flows, and the last ones occurred about 1.2 billion years ago. These
      elevations are called Marias.



      Regarding temperatures, the variation is very large between the hemisphere that is currently
      receiving illumination and its opposite. The first, which receives sunlight, has a
      temperature of up to 127 ° degrees Celsius, while on the face not illuminated by the Sun,
      the measurement is -173 ° degrees Celsius. The orbital movement that the Moon performs
      around the Earth produces certain phenomena perceived both in the elements present on the
      Earth's surface and in those visible in the sky, at specific periods.



      One of these phenomena occurs mainly in the oceans and is called tides. Tides consist of
      fluctuations in seawater level caused by the gravitational force of the Moon. Although it
      acts over the entire land mass, the effect is best seen in the oceans. This oscillation also
      produces currents used to generate electricity; a process is known as tidal energy. The
      tides and the movement of sea currents are still important for the maintenance of climates
      on planet Earth.
