                <h2>The Solar System</h2>
                <p>I have good news! For the next years, you and I will live together in a single very specific point in
                    the universe. More specifically, this point is the Earth Not just us but the Earth too, for the next
                    years we will live together with some planets, moons and asteroids in a specific place called: Solar
                    System. The solar system is defined by everything that is gravitationally bound to our sun (and it
                    is our home also). It consists in the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
                    and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and
                    meteoroids. But when did we discover that the Solar System is our house? In 1500 Nicolaus Copernicus
                    discovered that the planets orbit the Sun. Only the Moon orbits the Earth. But he was afraid of
                    people's reaction when he said this, so he didn't publish a full account of his ideas until 1543,
                    the year of his death. So, Galileo Galilei pointed a telescope at the sky. He discovered moons
                    orbiting Jupiter. He then verified that Copernicus might be right. It took 70 years to convince
                    scientists that planets orbit the Sun. Currently, many people know what the Solar System is. That's
                    it, this is our home. As residents of this wonderful place, we should meet our neighborhood! Please
                    fasten your seat belts, put on your spacesuit and join me on this journey into the Solar System.
